# @fsnjs/tokenize

`@fsnjs/tokenize` is a zero-dependency library that facilitates tokenization
for applications such as parsers or interpreters where incoming data
needs to be broken down into tokens for further processing.

The library's primary export is the abstract `Tokenizer` class
that is designed to take in a sequence of values
(e.g., characters, objects, etc.) and convert them into structured tokens
that can later be processed by another part of the application.

You can view [detailed documentation here](https://alexporrello.github.io/tokenize.js/)
and [examples here](https://github.com/alexporrello/tokenize.js/tree/main/src/example).
